Hereâ€™s an obligatory "Hello World" post. I have doubts about my motivation to keep a blog, but once in a while I have some things to write--I write for my school newspaper after-all. I'm sure my [project section](/projects/) will get used more for showcasing what I'm doing, but I may use this blog to discuss the adventure of doing them.

My website is a project with lots of history; I first made a website for myself in 2009, before then I had made a website for a game I used to host. As with most my mundane personal documentation efforts, I quickly grew bored of keeping up with them, the vast majority of my web pages were simply playgrounds for designing intricate chat-boxes, forums, and shameless HTML/JS exploitations in an effort to create a system in a web page.

I eventually lost interest in web programming, given its quick-gratifying nature. I moved on to designing complicated game engines, peer-to-peer networks, and trying my hand at inventing functional AI systems.

Ironically this web page is static and should never have the intention of becoming the mess that it has been in the past. AJAX and a mysql database, staples of my past sites, will be avoided. Aside from [materializecss](http://materializecss.com/) and its dependencies, I'll be striving to take [this](http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/) idea to heart.

While not my first materializecss webpage, this is the first time I'm using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). In the past I've used [staticjinja](http://staticjinja.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for static webpage development. While somewhat limited, Jekyll provides a very nice system to make a simple webpage. I would still prefer staticjinja for other use-cases.
