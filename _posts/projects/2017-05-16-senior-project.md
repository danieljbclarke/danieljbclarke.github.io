My capstone project sought to implement an artificial neural network in hardware. I successfully built and verified operation of a single neuron, testing it by using a raspberry pi connected to the circuit. You can view the presentation that won me first place at IEEE Region 1 Student Conference [here](/assets/2017-05-16-senior-project/reveal-js-presentation/). It's done in Reveal-js which lets you navigate forward by pressing space. The competition paper can be found [here](/assets//2017-05-16-senior-project/competition_paper.pdf), while my capstone paper is [here](/assets//2017-05-16-senior-project/capstone_paper.pdf) it goes more into the theory of operation while more of my results can be found later in this post.

TODO, walkthrough of testing and results
