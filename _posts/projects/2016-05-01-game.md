You can download, compile, and play this game as it was when I completed the course on your own machine if you have Visual Studio and DirectX. The source is [here](/assets/2016-05-01-game/game.zip). It was later completed, refined, and ported to OGRE in my free time. That source can be found [here](/assets/2016-05-01-game/game_ogre.zip). It'll certainly compile and run on Linux with the necessary libraries, I've never attempted to compile it for Windows.
