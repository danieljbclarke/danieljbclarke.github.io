# About

My name is Daniel J. B. Clarke. An active programmer and full-time student, I'm anticipating both my BS in Electrical Engineering, and MS in Computer Engineering in May of 2017. With more than 10 years of independent programming experience, several summers of industry and research experience in software engineering, and training as an Electrical Engineering undergraduate student heavily involved on campus, I have a broad exposure to the hardware-software stack and am most interested in the unison of the two. While involved in cybersecurity and big data analytics, I find myself most interested in building tools and back-end systems as opposed to front-facing applications.
