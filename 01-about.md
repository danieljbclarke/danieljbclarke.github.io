My name is Daniel J. B. Clarke. An active programmer and full-time student, I received a BS in Electrical Engineering and a MS in Computer Engineering in the May of 2017. With more than a decade of independent programming experience, several summers of industry and research experience in software engineering, and training as an Electrical Engineering undergraduate student heavily involved in research and competitions, I have a broad exposure to the hardware-software stack and am most interested in the places where they come together. While involved in cybersecurity and big data analytics, I find myself most interested in building tools and back-end systems as opposed to working on front-facing applications or applying well known methods.
