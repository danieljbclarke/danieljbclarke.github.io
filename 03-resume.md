### SUMMARY
---
My name is Daniel J. B. Clarke. An active programmer presently seeking admittance into graduate school. I received a BS in Electrical Engineering and a MS in Computer Engineering in May 2017. With more than a decade of independent programming experience, several summers of industry and research experience in software engineering, and training as an Electrical Engineering student heavily involved in research and competitions, I have a broad exposure to the hardware-software stack and have research interests ranging from big data analytics to analog circuit design with focuses on machine learning, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity, and in particular, I am most interested in the places where they come together.
